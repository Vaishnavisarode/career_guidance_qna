#  Career Guidance Q&A System

A lightweight, CPU-friendly question-answering system that helps users get guidance on various tech careers. It uses a Hugging Face dataset with `role`, `question`, and `answer` columns, and retrieves the most relevant answer based on the user's query using semantic similarity.

---

##  Features

-  Ask career-related questions like skills, salary, or learning paths.
-  Uses pre-trained Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic search.
-  No fine-tuning or training required â€” retrieval-based.
-  Fully runs on CPU (no GPU needed).
-  Built on a Hugging Face dataset: [`Pradeep016/career-guidance-qa-dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pradeep016/career-guidance-qa-dataset)
-  CLI-based interactive question-answering
-  Graceful exit on typing `exit`, `quit`, or `end`

##  How It Works

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("Pradeep016/career-guidance-qa-dataset")
```

- We load the dataset and combine `role` and `question` for context retrieval.
- User input is embedded using `SentenceTransformer`.
- Closest match is found using cosine similarity.
- The corresponding answer is shown.
